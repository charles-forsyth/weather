# Project Overview

This project contains two Python applications for monitoring weather conditions using the `api.weather.gov` service.

1.  **Weather GUI (`weather_gui.py`)**: A desktop graphical user interface built with Tkinter that displays detailed weather information, including current conditions, forecasts, moon phase, and a live radar image.
2.  **Weather LEDs (`weather_leds.py`)**: A script for Raspberry Pi that uses GPIO-connected LEDs to provide a simple, physical indication of temperature and precipitation.

The project also includes utility scripts for generating icons and testing API endpoints.

## Building and Running

### Dependencies

The applications require the following Python libraries:

*   `requests`: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
*   `Pillow` (PIL): For image processing in the GUI and icon generation.
*   `RPi.GPIO`: For controlling LEDs on a Raspberry Pi (for `weather_leds.py` only).

You can install the common dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install requests Pillow
```

### Running the Weather GUI

To run the graphical interface, execute the `weather_gui.py` script:

```bash
python3 weather_gui.py
```

The script will fork itself and run as a background process. To stop it, you will need to find and kill the process.

### Running the Weather LEDs (on Raspberry Pi)

To run the LED indicator script on a Raspberry Pi, execute the `weather_leds.py` script. You may need to run it with `sudo` depending on your GPIO configuration.

```bash
python3 weather_leds.py
```

The script can be run for a specific duration or in a self-test mode:
*   `python3 weather_leds.py --duration 3600` (run for 1 hour)
*   `python3 weather_leds.py --test` (run a self-test of the LEDs)

## Development Conventions

*   **API**: The project uses the public API from the U.S. National Weather Service (`api.weather.gov`).
*   **Coordinates**: The latitude and longitude are now managed in `config.py`. You can change the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` constants in `config.py` to get weather for a different location.
*   **Icons**: The icons used in the GUI are generated by the `generate_icons.py` script and are stored in the `icons/` directory.
*   **Styling**: The GUI uses a custom dark color palette defined at the top of `weather_gui.py`.
*   **Cleanup**: Unused files (`weather_gui_backup.py` and `pressure_test.py`) have been removed.
