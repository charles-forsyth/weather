# Project Overview

This project provides a suite of Python tools for monitoring and displaying weather information from the U.S. National Weather Service API. It is now structured as an installable Python package (`weather-suite`). It includes a graphical desktop application, a Raspberry Pi LED indicator, and utility scripts for icon generation.

## Building and Running

### Dependencies

The application dependencies are now managed via `setup.py`.

### Installation

To install the package, navigate to the project root and run:
```bash
pip install .
```
This will make the `weather-gui` and `weather-leds` commands available globally.

### Running the Weather GUI

To run the graphical interface, execute the `weather-gui` command:

```bash
weather-gui
```

The script will fork itself and run as a background process. To stop it, you will need to find and kill the process.

### Running the Weather LEDs (on Raspberry Pi)

To run the LED indicator script on a Raspberry Pi, execute the `weather-leds` command. You may need to run it with `sudo` depending on your GPIO configuration.

```bash
weather-leds
```

The script can be run for a specific duration or in a self-test mode:
*   `weather-leds --duration 3600` (run for 1 hour)
*   `weather-leds --test` (run a self-test of the LEDs)

## Development Conventions

*   **API**: The project uses the public API from the U.S. National Weather Service (`api.weather.gov`).
*   **Coordinates**: The latitude and longitude are now managed in `weather/config.py`. You can change the `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` constants in `weather/config.py` to get weather for a different location.
*   **Icons**: The icons used in the GUI are generated by the `generate_icons.py` script and are stored in the `weather/icons/` directory. These icons are loaded using `importlib.resources` for robust path resolution within the installed package.
*   **Styling**: The GUI uses a custom dark color palette defined at the top of `weather/gui.py`.
*   **Cleanup**: Unused files (`weather_gui_backup.py` and `pressure_test.py`) have been removed.
*   **Packaging**: The project is now structured as a Python package, installable via `pip`.
